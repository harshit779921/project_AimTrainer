## TODO

In the development of an aim training game, several libraries play crucial roles in enabling various functionalities. Pygame, a powerful library specifically designed for game development in Python, stands out as the cornerstone. With Pygame, developers gain access to tools and functions that facilitate tasks such as creating graphics, handling user input, and managing game states. This library provides a robust framework for building interactive and visually appealing games, making it an essential component of the aim training game's development process. Additionally, libraries like math and random are utilized to implement game mechanics such as calculating trajectories, generating randomized targets, and managing game logic. Time is another essential library employed for tracking game duration, implementing timers, and controlling game flow. Together, these libraries form the backbone of the aim training game, enabling developers to create an engaging and immersive gaming experience.

### How to use it?

All you have to do just run the code and a window  will appear, where the Aim Trainer is located. You can move your mouse and hit the target and improve your skills.- Download the repository as a ZIP file and just install the libraries which is needed to use it.
